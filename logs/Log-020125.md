echo "Finding large files over 500MB..."
find ~ -type f -size +500M -exec ls -lh {} \;
echo "Manually review and delete if necessary."
```

On Desktop 
```
ls -lh | sort -rh -k5
```
* Explanation:
  *  ls -lh â†’ Lists files in human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
  * sort -rh -k5 â†’ Sorts the output:
  * -r â†’ Reverse order (largest first).
  * -h â†’ Human-readable sort (understands MB/GB sizes).
  * -k5 â†’ Sort by the 5th column, which is where ls -lh prints file sizes.
